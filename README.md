This project is a To-Do List Web App that allows users to manage tasks, mark them as completed, and edit or delete them. The app uses React (Frontend), Express (Backend), MongoDB (Database), and GitHub OAuth for authentication.

## Changes from Assignment 3 ##
- Reimplemented a3 to use React components
- Changed the authorizing from localstorage to GitHub Passport
